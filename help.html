<p>I found out that all the python libraries on the internet are too complicated to use and require you to install a gazillion dependencies, so I tried to make this one super easy to use. All you have to do is implement two functions: <code>render(t)</code> gets called on each frame of the animation and it needs to draw the screen, and <code>init()</code> get called each time the animation restarts.</p>
<p>I provided a few basic drawing functions. Whenever the functions refer to a color, you can just provide a string like "blue" or "red" and it'll do what you'd expect. If you want to be fancy you can pick an HTML color from a color picker like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">this one</a> (e.g. <code>"#cc9900"</code> is orange-ish).</p>
<p><code>clear(color)</code>: Clears the screen back to whatever color you specify (white by default)</p>
<p><code>draw_rect(x, y, width, height, color)</code>: Draws a rectangle with the top-left corner at (x, y) and a certain width and height and color</p>
<p><code>draw_circle(x, y, radius, color)</code>: Draws a circle with the center at (x,y) and a certain radius and color</p>
<p><code>draw_line(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, color, thickness)</code>: Draws a line from (start_x, start_y) to (end_x, end_y) with a certain color and thickness.</p>
<p><code>draw_image(url, x, y, width, height)</code>: Load the image from the given URL online, and draw it with the top-left corner at (x, y), resized to a certain width and height. (Width and height are optional, if you leave them out the image will just stay its original size.)</p>
<p><code>rgb(r,g,b)</code>: Make a color from a red, green, and blue component (each in the range of 0-255).
<p>That's all I've got for now, but I'll make more if people ask for them :) Or if you really want to you can just bypass my code and draw using the <code>context</code> object directly (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D">documentation</a>).</p>
